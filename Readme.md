# Used Car Pricing

This is a mini project which aims to create a model which would predict prices of used cars. The dataset is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database) which in turn is scrabed from Ebay-Kleinanzeigen.

All codes are stored as IPython Notebooks.

- [preprocessing.ipynb](preprocessing.ipynb) contains the preprocessing code
- [model.ipynb](model.ipynb) contains the machine learning code
- [cleaned_data.csv](cleaned_data.csv) is the dataset which has been preprocessed
